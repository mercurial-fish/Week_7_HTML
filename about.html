<h2>About Me and Spoon Fed</h2>

<p>Hello! And welcome to Spoon Fed: A Queer Parents' Guide to Stuff You Can Watch With Your Kids. I am your host, Dezi Cruz. <br>

    For those of you just tuning in, let me tell you a little bit about me. I am a queer, non-binary, neurodivergent parent of two kids. <br> 
    They are 6 and 8 years old, so I've got a few years under my belt. And in my personal experience, due to limited time, <br> 
    limited emotional bandwidth, and the million other things that make it hard to exist as a human being, I have found that my kids and I <br> 
    can really connect when we watch TV/Movies that we all enjoy. Even if I can't sit down to watch it start to finish with them, <br> 
    I'm more likely to be engaged with what they're doing and watching if it's something I also find interesting. And then it gives us things <br> 
    we can discuss or talk about. It also gives me an opportunity to point out some potentially problematic things, because, let's face it, <br> 
    anything made before 2015 is probably gonna have some transphobic shit in it. And not just that, but racist or sexist or homophobic. <br> 
    Doesn't mean the whole show or movie is bad, but it's something that is good to point out, so they don't internalize that stuff as normal. <br> 
    Butttt it's hard for me to catch any of that stuff if I am so bored with what they're watching that I've tuned it out. <br>

    <br>
    
    So long story short, my aim here is to help queer parents connect with their kids by giving movie and TV suggestions that everyone will truly enjoy, <br> 
    along with some talking points to help get the ball rolling.</p>


<h3>Why should you listen?</h3>
    <p>Because I have taken out the guesswork! In about 20 minutes, you'll have an overview of the movie and talking points, <br>
    so all you have to do is decide whether or not you want to watch it with your kids.</p>

<h3>Where can you start?</h3>
<p>
    You don't need to start from the very beginning or go in order. <br>
    Just because I like all of these movies, doesn't mean you do. And I <br>
    know there may be certain types of movies you're vehemently opposed to. <br>
